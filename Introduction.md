# Big Data Masters Journey

I will be blogging throughout my journey of MSc in Big Data Analytics, whatever I find useful as theory and best practices. Hope it will ease someone's life out there. 

## What is Big Data?

Often Big Data is described simply and clearly using the 5V's concept. It could also in some places be described in 3V's.

- Velocity

The change in the data is rapid. 
- Volume

Large amounts of data are being generated every second. In the context of Facebook, we can think of each photo uploaded, each post shared, and each reaction to a post as user data. Such interactions of 3.3 billion users(as of December 2023) generate an immense amount of data.
- Variety

Data comes in many forms. Text, photo, video, tables, etc. The structures of data can be divided into structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.

- Veracity

Can the data be trusted? Is it giving accurate information? These kinds of flavors are addressed under veracity.
- Value

Data alone is not enough. How valuable is the data that we have collected? Is it possible to create value out of it?

## Examples to think of. How big is big data?

Think of the data generated on **Netflix**. Netflix has 247 Million subscribers as of January 2024. All these users have a particularly large dataset with them.

The total watch hours of their watched content. The resume times of each content they watch. The devices which they have watched. The liked content. Think of 247 Million Users with all of the above data.

Similarly, you can interpret the amount of data generated every second through websites and applications like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Trip Advisor, Booking, etc. Keeping aside these major data platforms that come into mind, there are other scientific applications that generate vast amounts of data. The Hadron Collider generates more data per year than the number of tweets generated in a year. 

Other scientific applications such as weather forecasting, Google Flu Trends, and Earthquake warnings, also rely on Big Data.

## What is Big Data Analytics?

Big data analytics refers to the process of collecting, organizing, and analyzing big data to discover patterns and other useful information.

### Note

I would like to quote the following from the book "Hadoop, The Definitive Guide" which leaves a nice touch for the introduction.

**_"It has been said that “more data usually beats better algorithms,” which is to say that for
some problems (such as recommending movies or music based on past preferences),
however fiendish your algorithms, often they can be beaten simply by having more data
(and a less sophisticated algorithm).[5]
The good news is that big data is here. The bad news is that we are struggling to store and
analyze it."_**
