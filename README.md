# Big Data Masters Journey

I will be blogging throughout my journey of MSc in Big Data Analytics, whatever I find useful as theory and best practices. Hope it will ease someone's life out there. 

## What is Big Data?

Often Big Data is described simply and clearly using the 5V's concept. It could also in some places be described in 3V's.

- Velocity
The change in the data is rapid. 
- Volume
Large amounts of data are being generated every second. In the context of Facebook, we can think of each photo uploaded, each post shared, and each reaction to a post as user data. Such interactions of 3.3 billion users(as of December 2023) generate an immense amount of data.
- Variety
Data comes in many forms. Text, photo, video, tables, etc. The structures of data can be divided into structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.

- Veracity
Can the data be trusted? Is it giving accurate information? These kinds of flavors are addressed under veracity.
- Value
Data alone is not enough. How valuable is the data that we have collected? Is it possible to create value out of it?
